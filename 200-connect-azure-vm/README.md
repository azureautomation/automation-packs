# Connect to an Azure Virtual Machine

[![Deploy Runbook to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fazureautomation%2Fautomation-packs%2Fmaster%2F200-connect-azure-vm%2FdeployRunbookAndCredential.json)

This runbook sets up a connection to an Azure virtual machine (classic). It requires the Azure virtual machine to have the Windows Remote Management service enabled, which is the default. It sets up a connection to the Azure subscription and then imports the certificate used for the Azure VM so remote PowerShell calls can be made to it.

It uses the Azure Service Management module.
