[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3a%2f%2fraw.githubusercontent.com%2fazureautomation%2fautomation-packs%2fmaster%2f201-Deploy-And-Compile-DSC-Configuration%2fazuredeploy.json)

This DSC configuration installs a full blown webserver.
The configuration file gets imported and compiled.
Once the DSC configuration is published and compiled it can be consumed by any registered DSC node.

#Requirements
A DSC configuration is made available in the folder Configurations.
a guid for the jobId parameter, you can create a guid using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
#PowerShell < v5
[System.Guid]::NewGuid()

#PowerShell v5
$JobGUID = (New-Guid).Guid

```

#Known limitations

- I had an issue using a DSC Configuration link containing spaces
- Configurations can only be deployed as 'Published' during the preview

#Resources deployed

- Automation account
- DSC Configuration: webrolefull, with a node named 'Full'
  reference the DSc configuration as webrolefull.Full

```PowerShell
Configuration webrolefull {

    $features = @(
        @{Name = "Web-Server"; Ensure = "Present"},
        @{Name = "Web-WebServer"; Ensure = "Present"},

    node full {

        foreach ($feature in $features){
            WindowsFeature ($feature.Name) {
                Name = $feature.Name
                Ensure = $feature.Ensure
